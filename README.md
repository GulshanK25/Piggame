👨‍💻 Description
Our project is about a very famous dice game named Pig, Where the first player to make 100 wins the game. in our project, we have given user an option either to play against our self made Computer player or to compete against their own friend!. The game starts with the rules being first displayed and make sure the user understands them. after that the user wll be asked for the name or names and then here we go, the competion starts. one catch int the game is that if the user diesnt hold on his score and roll 1, their whole round score is  gone which we nammed as "PIGGED" and the turn shifts to next person!!!
